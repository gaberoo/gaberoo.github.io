    <p>
      I started out my academic life at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale
      de Lausanne (<a href="http://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a>). Motivated by
      a boyhood fantasy of space exploration and futuristic gadgets, I
      started my studies in phyics. I was especially interested in 
      <a href="https://home.cern/topics/antimatter/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem">matter-antimatter asymmetry</a>,
      but little did I know that resolving this questions was not something
      that would be easily done by a single individual. Although I to this
      day am astonished by the mathematical elegance of differential 
      geometry as a representation of general relativity, and the ability
      to represent particles of the standard model by symmetries of a 
      Hamiltonian, I slowly became much more interested in questions
      related to life on Earth.
    </p>

    <p>
      My foray into the biological world begun as an undergraduate exchange
      student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
      (<a href="http://www.ust.hk">HKUST</a>), where I begain working
      on complex networks and various applications in biology, such as
      the spread of infectious diseases. This focus followed me back to
      the EPFL, where I continued working in network epidemiology with
      <a href="https://lbs.epfl.ch">Paolo de Los Rios</a>. My Master's
      thesis work on a coarse graining method spin glasses with
      <a href="http://cnets.indiana.edu/aflammin/">Sandro Flammini</a>
      marked my last adventure in the world of traditional physics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just before starting my PhD work at the 
      <a href="http://www.ethz.ch">ETH Zurich</a>,
      I spent volunteered as a quantitative analyist in Senegal and 
      Cameroon for the 
      <a href="https://clintonhealthaccess.org/">
        Clinton Health Access Initiative
      </a>, in a stereotypical attempt to give back to the
      world some of the knowledge and skills I had learned. 
      Although saving the world singlehandely was as naive
      as building hyperspace-capable spaceships, this was quite an
      transformative experience and marked my first
      exposure to public health related issues, and specifically HIV
      epidemiology. Surprisingly unrelated, my subsequent PhD work
      with <a href="http://www.tb.ethz.ch/">Sebastian Bonhoeffer</a>
      married my previous network epidemiology work with public health.
      More importantly, I was introduced to evolutionary biology, 
      phylogenetics and phylodynamics, (with <a href="https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo">Tanja
      Stadler</a>), 
      and&mdash;through a close interaction of Sebastian's group
      and the groups of 
      <a href="http://www.emeritus.eco.ethz.ch/">Paul Schmid-Hempel</a>
      and 
      <a href="http://www.mme.ethz.ch">Martin Ackermann</a>'s
      groups&mdash; evolutionary ecology and evolutionary microbiology.
    </p>

    <p>
      As part of my PhD, I became interested in ecological networks 
      (e.g. food webs and plant-pollinator networks). Similar to the lack
      of prior work on bringing evolutionary thinking into network
      epidemiology&mdash;which I worked on together with 
      <a href="http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~alhill/">Alison Hill</a>
      &mdash;there appeared to be a similar lack of integration
      of evolutionary approaches into ecological interaction networks.
      This eventually lead to my current focus on microbial communities with 
      <a href="http://https://www.corderolab.org/">Otto Cordero</a> at 
      <a href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a>, 
      where I am studying the effects of community structure on the evolution
      of the individual community members.
