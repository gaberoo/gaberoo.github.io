          <p>
            Species communities in ecosystem are mostly studied with respect
            to their overal community structure, and in particular how the
            interactions between species influence the stability and function
            of the community. The type and structure of these interactions,
            however, will also affect the evolution of the individual members
            within a community. This is particularly important for microbial
            communities, where evolutionary and ecological processes happen on
            similar timescales. I am interested in how interactions between
            microbes within consortia influence not only the functioning
            of the communitiy, but also the evolutionary outcomes that are
            expected when these communities are exposed to abiotic environmental
            changes. This approach goes beyond the current trends in the field
            microbial ecology and integrates evolutionary considerations into
            the study marine communities, industrial bioreactor communities and
            human/animal microbiomes.

          <p>
            The interaction of species in ecosystems can be
            represented by networks, in which species either prey on each other
            (food webs or trophic networks) or where interactions between species
            are mutually beneficial (mutualistic networks). The criteria which
            determine the stability of such networks is different for trophic and
            mutualistic networks, however. Interactions between species in real
            eco-systems are both trophic and mutualistic and thus non-trivial
            situations can arise when mixing the two. Using simulations of species
            interactions on networks based on real data, I investigate the change
            in stability conditions for networks that are both mutualistic and
            trophic.

          <p>
            Most results in mathematical epidemiology are based on
            fairly strong assumptions of random mixing in susceptible populations.
            However, real contact networks display a high degree of complexity
            such that a more detailed description of the interactions is needed.
            Based on the framework graph theory, I'm trying to understand the
            effects of such heterogeneity on pathogen evolution in such complex
            host systems.

          <p>
            Phylodynamic inference estimates epidemiological
            parameters from pathogen sequence data that is collected during an
            epidemic outbreak. Until recently, the statistical models that have
            been employed made crude assumptions about the underlying dynamical
            model. I develop phylodynamic models that account for realistic
            epidemiological dynamics, such as SIR-type model.
